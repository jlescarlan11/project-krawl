## 🎯 Problem-Solution Fit

**Problem:** No platform effectively combines community-sourced local knowledge with structured, navigable experiences for discovering authentic Filipino culture.

**Solution:** Krawl provides a community-driven PWA that enables users to map cultural "Gems" and create guided "Krawls" with offline-capable, location-aware navigation.

## 🗺️ Launch Area: Cebu City Only

**Initial Launch Focus:** Cebu City, Philippines

**Map Boundary Restrictions:**
- Map view limited to Cebu City boundaries only
- Gem creation restricted to locations within Cebu City
- Krawl creation limited to trails within Cebu City
- Search and discovery features scoped to Cebu City area
- Location validation enforces Cebu City boundaries

**Rationale:**
- Focused launch allows for deeper content curation and community building
- Easier to validate core features with concentrated user base
- Better quality control with limited geographic scope
- Foundation for future expansion to other cities

**Future Expansion:**
- Metro Manila and other Philippine cities planned post-MVP
- Expansion based on user feedback and validation from Cebu City launch
