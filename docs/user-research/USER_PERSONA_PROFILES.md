## Notes

### Important Considerations

1. **Persona Validation:** These personas are based on project assumptions and target audience analysis. They should be validated through user research and updated based on real user data after launch.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity:** All personas respect Filipino culture and local communities. Persona descriptions should be culturally sensitive and respectful.

3. **Free Tools Focus:** All personas require free access to core features. Krawl must remain free and accessible, using free-tier services suitable for student projects.

4. **Social Login Only:** All personas prefer social login (Google) for authentication. Krawl should implement social login only, avoiding traditional email/password authentication.

5. **Current as of 2025-11-14:** This document reflects the current state of user personas as of November 14, 2025. Personas should be updated based on user research and actual user behavior.

6. **Agile Principles:** Personas should remain adaptable and responsive to user feedback, embracing agile principles in persona development and refinement.

7. **Technology Verification:** All recommended technologies have been verified as current and well-maintained as of November 14, 2025. Technologies should be re-verified periodically to ensure they remain current.
