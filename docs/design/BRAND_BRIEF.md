## Brand Story

Krawl was born from a simple observation: the most authentic cultural experiences are often hidden, known only to locals who have lived and breathed the culture. While commercial platforms focus on tourist attractions and paid placements, the genuine heart of Filipino culture—the neighborhood eateries, the local artisans, the community gathering places, the historical sites with untold stories—remains unmapped and undiscovered.

**The Journey Begins:**

The idea for Krawl emerged from conversations with young Filipinos in Cebu City who expressed frustration at the difficulty of finding authentic cultural experiences. They wanted to discover the real Cebu—the places where locals gather, the spots with cultural significance, the trails that tell stories of Filipino heritage. But existing platforms were either too commercial, too generic, or too focused on tourist attractions.

**The Solution:**

Krawl was conceived as a community-driven platform where locals could map their cultural knowledge, creating "Gems" (points of interest) and "Krawls" (guided trails) that connect these cultural experiences. Unlike commercial platforms, Krawl prioritizes authenticity over advertising, community knowledge over corporate content, and cultural preservation over commercialization.

**The Name:**

"Krawl" is a play on the word "crawl"—suggesting a slow, deliberate exploration of culture, taking time to discover and appreciate each cultural gem. The name also evokes the idea of a trail or path, connecting multiple cultural points in a meaningful journey.

**The Vision:**

Starting in Cebu City, Krawl aims to become the living map of Filipino culture—a platform that grows richer with each community contribution, preserving cultural heritage while making authentic discovery accessible to all.

**The Promise:**

Krawl promises to be the platform where authentic Filipino culture is discovered, shared, and preserved—by the community, for the community, and for future generations.
